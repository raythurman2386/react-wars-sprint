   > state is data that belongs to the application or component.

1. Describe props.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
   > A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. Fetching data from an API, timers, logging, and manually manipulating the DOM are all examples of side effects. You can use the effect hook to sync effects in react by passing the data to be sync'd into an array attached to the useEffect.
